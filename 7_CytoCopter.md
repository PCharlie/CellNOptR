CytoCopteR provides an intuitive and easy to learn graphical user interface (GUI) to [CellNOptR](https://saezlab.github.io/CellNOptR/7_CytoCopter/)

This results in a point and click interface where users can run the same steps as they would using an R script without having to actually write any code. Given that this is a front-end to the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) algorithms, consistency is ensured between the results obtained through the GUI and those obtained through the corresponding scripts.

# Download
