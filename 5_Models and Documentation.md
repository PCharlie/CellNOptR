# TCellPCB2007

##  I. Description

This model comes from the reference here below. The SIF file was generated from the reactions file found on CNA website (Tcell data from 2007 published in Plos Computational biology, Aug 2007 Saez et al.). The generation was performed using read_reactions.py that converts the reaction to SIF file called TCellPCB2007.sif.

# ToyMMB_T2

##  I. Description

This directory contains the example to test the analysis of a 2-time point data set. The file **PKN-ToyMMB_T2.sif** is a model used in several articles and for many tests in CellNOpt. The accompanying data **MD-ToyMMB_T2.csv** was generated by Camille Terfve for the CellNOptR tutorial.

In addition to PKN-ToyMMB.sif, this model contains a inhibitor from cJun to Jnk.

# ToyPB

##  I. Description

The PKN network **PKN-ToyPB.sif** is used in the reference below. It was generated manually based on the network contained in Saez-Rodriguez et al. (2011). This network is designed to output a variety of dynamics (oscillations, transience etc.) to test all CNOR formalisms.

Note that in the paper cited here below (MacNamara), the data was generated using CNORode software with a modified version of the model. The **True** Model is called **PKN-ToyPB_True.sif**. The differences are as follows:

| **PKN-ToyPB** | **PKN-ToyPB_True** |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| map3k7–>mkk4 OR map3k7–>mkk4 | This is a logical AND gate only |
| egfr–>sos OR ph–/sos | This is a logical AND gate only (egfr–>sos AND ph–/sos ) |
| connection from pi3k to rac added |  |
| connection from tnfr to pi3k added |  |
| new node (rac) between pi3k and map3k1 |  |
| Node ask1 removed |  |

**MacNamara et al.** *State-time spectrum of signal transduction logic models* Physical Biology, submitted (2012).

**Note:** The directory contains a SIF file named ToyModelPB.sif but also a PKN-ToyPB_shuffled.sif that has exactly the same topology. However, this second file has a different arrangements of reactions. When compressed and expanded, the resulting models are different. This is a known bug and these 2 files can be used to debug that issue. The file MD-ToyPB_2timePoints.csv is a subset of ToyModelPB.csv that contains the time points 0, 10 and 30 seconds only.

# ToyPCB

##  I. Description

This model is used in the references here below. The network was generated manually from the paper. The data was generated manually from the matlab data in the CNO matlab repository (Data/SampleData/ToyModelPCB). Experiments with stimuli set to zero (all NA) were removed.

# ToyPB_SBML

##  I. Description

The PKN network **PKN-ToyPB_SBML.sif** is made of the content of the SBMLqual Model.xml used in the reference below. This is almost the same model as *PKN-ToyPB_True.sif* except for an additional self-loop added on **ph** node.

There is no data provided but one could use the data used in ToyPB that was generated from **ToyPB_True** model (same except for the self-loop).
